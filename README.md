indigenousVision is an AI-augmented strategic intelligence pipeline designed to detect, structure, and elevate emerging signals related to Indigenous Peoples and their ecosystems around the world.

🎯 Purpose
The goal is to provide an automated tool for semantic monitoring, capable of:

Detecting calls for proposals and funding opportunities

Identifying emerging global trends (in rights, climate, governance, education, traditional knowledge, etc.)

Structuring the data into a knowledge graph usable by AI models

🧠 Key Features
🔎 Content extraction from RSS feeds and online articles

🧹 Cleaning, parsing, and JSON structuring

🧠 GPT-based relevance scoring and metadata enrichment

⏳ Expiration filtering for outdated content

🔐 Semantic storage and traceability

🧭 Coming soon: Concept graph generation and smart query engine

🌿 Why this project?
In a world where Indigenous perspectives are often underrepresented, indigenousVision offers an ethical, open-source, and AI-enabled approach to strengthen visibility, strategic insight, and collective intelligence.
